		 	<h1> {{gemStones.name}}</h1>
		 	<h2>${{gemStones.price}}</h2>
		 	<h3>{{gemStones.desc}}</h3>
		 	<!-- However I want the button to show up only in canpurchase attribute is true-->
		 	<!-- 6 So, we use the ng-show directive. What this does is it triggers the element only if the value of the expression is true -->
		 	<button ng-show = "gemStones.canpurchase"> Add to Cart </button>
		 	<!--8 Now, lets use the attribute Sold OUt if soldout is true, we don't want to show the product on the page at all so we go ahead and define the div inside the StoreController directive controller. 
		 	We can however, use the ng-hide directive here-->
