<!--
In this tutorial we will show you how to use directives with data models.
What we are going to do is to have an HTML form asking people to type in
their names and build a data model behind the scene and dynamically
print that onto the HTML Page
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app>
  <!-- The use of ng-app over here is basically decalring that this is an angular app-->
